# Microarray Gene Expression Enrichment Analysis of Kidney Transplant

## Kidney Transplant Rejection
Currently approximately 40% of kidney transplants fail within 10 years (Lai et al. 2021). Two prevalent types of CKTR are T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and antibody mediated rejection (ABMR). TCMR occurs when the interstitium is infiltrated by T cells and macrophages (P. F. Halloran 2010). On the other hand, ABMR is more common and occurs when donor-specific-antibodies such as anti-HLA antibodies work against the transplanted kidney, and incite its rejection (Zhang 2017).

## Current Therapeutics
The current primary treatment regime for TCMR is immunosuppressive therapy with methylprednisolone which has facilitated a successful decline in acute rejection rates to 7% one year post-transplant (Kwon et al. 2021; Brennan and Malone 2022). However, the use of glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone coincide with adverse side-effects such as increased risk of infectious diseases and life-threatening metabolic effects like muscle-wasting and osteoporosis (Walker and Wells 2016). Therefore, there is value in facilitating the discovery of new drug targets for immunosuppression with higher specificity and less potent side effects.

Acute TCMR is often associated with long-term chronic ABMR likely due an activation mechanism whereby T-cells can induce differentiation of B-cells into antibody producing plasma cells (Schmitz et al. 2020; Tsuji et al. 2020). Late-stage ABMR is considered the primary cause for kidney graft loss and strikingly, there is an absence of clinically proven therapies, with weak evidence or small cohorts in most studies (Budde and DÃ¼rr 2018). Various immunosuppressive therapies remain the current consensus for treatment but importantly they do not necessarily prevent end-stage renal failure. Thus, there is a need for greater understanding towards the pathogenesis of ABMR to find novel therapeutic targets.

## Our Aim
However, the discovery of such targets is non-trivial as there are a variety of datasets with different outcome classifications and the extraction of stable target biomarkers is not straightfoward. Our aim was to create an app that facilitates the interrogation of microarray data collected from patients with ABMR/TCMR outcomes, to identify significant genes, relevant molecular processes and attain an appreciation for how genes interact in concert. Identifying over-represented pathways, allows the development of selectively-inhibiting or activating therapeutics that can down or upregulate pathways relevant to pathogenesis, hopefully leading to better patient outcomes (Hishikawa, Hayashi, and Itoh 2018).

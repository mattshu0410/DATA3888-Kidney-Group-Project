This app is a kidney rejection analysis tool for pharmaceutical researchers that aims to increase our understanding of the influence of different genes on kidney graft acceptance or rejection. The tool demonstrates the influence that different genes have on T-Cell Mediated and Antibody-Mediated Rejection by predicting the rejection of different gene profiles and comparing gene pathways on data analysis plots. By revealing the genes that attribute to ABMR/TCMR and acceptance, this app will provide pharmaceutical researchers with the information necessary to create medication that targets the  gene pathways responsible for rejection, imcluding a less destructive immunosuppressant, or new medication that can reduce the effects of rejection ."),

Since more than 90,000 patients are in need of a kidney and only 20,000 kidney transplants occur each year, the utility of a kidney rejection analysis tool for pharmaceutical researchers is considerable ('Rejection of a transplanted kidney', 2022).  The creation of a tool that can be used in the drug discovery pipeline to aid the identification of new transcription-specific targets will aid the mitigation of kidney rejection risk by providing information that will improve the treatment of ABMR and TCMR.

ABMR occurs when anti-donor specific antibodies such as anti-HLA antibodies work against the transplanted kidney, and incite its rejection. Unlike TCMR, the risk of kidney rejection from ABMR is a long term concern that increases overtime. Due to advancements in medical technology, ABMR now poses the largest threat to kidney rejection, accounting for graft failure in 64% of rejected transplants. ABMR peaks 5 years after transplantation, and therefore is more difficult to manage.(Kwon, H. et al, 2021)"),

TCMR occurs when the instersitium is infiltrated by T cells and macrophages and is characterised by decreased urine output and proteinuria. (Halloran P. F., 2010). TCMR affects about 10-12% of patients and  is a less common cause of rejection in comparison to other conditions. This is because TCMR can be easily controlled as numerous medicinal methods of management have been introduced. TCMR develops as soon as a week after transplantation and its risk of rejection reduces over time (Halloran P. F., 2010). As such the risk of rejection due to TCMR peaks in the short term and slowly reduces over time."),

It is basic biological knowledge that when the immune system is fighting forreign cells, its first response is to mobilise the utility of T-cells. Subsequently, since T-cells are necessary for the activation of B-cells, ABMR cannot occur without the preexistence of TCMR. Accordingly, to account for this ideology, this app will also target the identification of genes that attribute to TCMR, because it is a contributing factor to the inducement of AMBR. Furthermore, this can also assist pharmaceutical  researchers in determining new methods to optimise the level and method of immunosuppressive therapy used  for each patient."),
